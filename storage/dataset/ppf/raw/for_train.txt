Do you ever feel stressed about something silly and unimportant because it's too difficult to think about the actual big things you're stressed about? Yeahme neither	Even though I have lots going on, I never have the need to feel stressed about them.
I love my work fam more than anything, but if I have to go into work like this, I'm going to be job hunting again. :(	I'm so lucky to have such lovely work colleagues, hopefully I can enter work into a situation I am happy with.
Brain freeze. Not cut out for studying and dreading a whole 3 hour closed book exam tomorrow :-(	Studying is hard but it will be worth doing it in my closed book exam tomorow.
